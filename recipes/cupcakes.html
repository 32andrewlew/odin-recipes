    <p>Chocolate cupcakes with pumpkin cheesecake filling are a delicious combination of rich, moist chocolate cake and a creamy pumpkin smoothness inside.</p>

        <li>⅓ cup white sugar </li>

        <li>⅛ teaspoon salt </li>
        <li>½ cup semisweet chocolate chips, or more to taste </li>
    </ul>
    <ol>

        <li>Place cream cheese, 1/3 cup sugar, egg, pumpkin, yellow food coloring, red food coloring, and salt in a bowl. Beat using an electric mixer until thoroughly combined and no lumps remain. Stir in chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Whisk flour, 1 cup sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, and 1/2 teaspoon salt together in a large bowl. Mix in water, oil, vinegar, and vanilla extract until batter is well blended.</li>
