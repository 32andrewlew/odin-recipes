    <h1>Pumpkin Cookies with Cream Cheese Frosting</h1>
    <p><img src="../images/pumpkin-cookies.jpg" width="500" height="500" alt="pumpkin cooies"></p>
    <p>After getting this recipe from a friend, I have made them over 100 times for family and friends and they are always a hit, especially around Halloween and Thanksgiving! As far as the spices go, less is more; this is not a full-on pumpkin pie or pumpkin bread/cake. They're light and moist cookies with a taste of fall in every bite! </p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger </li>
        <li>1 cup butter </li>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar </li>
        <li>¾ cup brown sugar </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract </li>
        <li>1 egg </li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree </li>
        <li>1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened </li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract </li>
        <li>2 cups confectioners' sugar </li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Whisk flour, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, nutmeg, and ginger together in a bowl. Beat 1 cup butter, white sugar, brown sugar, 2 teaspoons vanilla extract, and egg with an electric mixer in a separate large bowl, beating until mixture is smooth. Beat in pumpkin puree. Gradually stir dry ingredients into pumpkin mixture. Batter will be moist.</li>
        <li>Spoon batter by teaspoonfuls about 2 inches apart onto prepared baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cookies cool for about 5 minutes on sheets before removing to finish cooling on waxed paper.</li>
        <li>Beat cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract in a bowl with an electric mixer until soft and creamy. Beat in confectioners' sugar, about 1/2 cup at a time, until frosting is smooth and spreadable. Frost cooled cookies with cream cheese frosting.</li>
    </ol>
